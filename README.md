BitMe is a bitrate calculator, with a different appearance. Licensed under the GNU General Public License, it is free software and comes with no warranty.

The program goes back a long time. Its first version, originally called "The Bitrate Calculator," later BitMe, was written while I was still in high school (2003 or 2004). That old version was put together in Visual Basic and certainly looked pretty, but I longed for something better. Later, when I learned C++, I rewrote it in that language, along with MFC, releasing version 2.x on SourceForge in 2007. Then, in 2013, I wrote BitMe from scratch again, with a sounder architecture, but keeping the old appearance. In 2016, I tackled the challenge of adding support for any container or codec. Unfortunately, that work was left incomplete and I never touched it till 2021. Then, cutting out the idea of working with any codec, and using an approximate method, I simplified the system, keeping the concept of various containers and adding more. So far, it is working, but will benefit from tuning and having missing containers added (something I hope I will tackle over time). The present system is rough, so if you find the overhead calculations too far from the mark, turn it off, from the "Calculation" menu.
